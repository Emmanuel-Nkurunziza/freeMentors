# freeMentors

The freeMentors is an application that assist learners (Users/young people) to advance in their career through free mentorship sessions provided by established professionals (mentors). 

This App allows users(learners/clients) to be created (sign up and sign in), and interact with the mentors who have volunteered to assist them. This means that users request mentorship sessions. Then if their mentorship session request is accepted, they land to a page in which allow users to view all mentors and be able to request a mentorship session from a particular mentor of their choice.

Mentors can accept the requested mentorship or decline to it.
If the learner’s request is accepted, he/she is directed to a forum (Mentorship Board) and ask a question to the mentor. The Mentor offers mentorships by answering questions from learners. When they receive answers from Mentors, learners can review or comment on the answer he/she received.  

The freeMentors App has also an administration to overseer activities on the App. Admin user has all the privileges including deleting the learner’s inappropriate review to the mentorship offered and upgrading an advanced learner to become a mentor.
